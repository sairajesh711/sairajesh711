<h1 align="center">Sai Rajesh Donkana | AI Product Manager (FinTech & MLOps)</h1>

<p align="center">
I build robust, focused projects that bridge the gap between enterprise FinTech, MLOps, and hands-on ML. My work translates complex technical challenges into clear, customer-centric products, drawing on experience scaling lending products at <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>, defining MLOps user journeys at <strong>RagaAI</strong>, and building ML models at <strong>Citi</strong>.
