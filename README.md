<h1 align="center">Sai Rajesh Donkana | AI Product Manager (FinTech & MLOps)</h1>

<p align="center">
My journey into product began with a fascination for neural networks and ML during my engineering studies at <strong>NIT Trichy</strong>. This curiosity led me from building web and Android apps to a 3-year stint as a Software Developer at <strong>Citi</strong>, where I built real-world financial tools. Driven to understand the "why" behind the "what," I pursued an MBA at <strong>IIM Bangalore</strong> to bridge the gap between technical execution and business strategy—a journey I accelerated with hands-on PM experience at the AI startup <strong>RagaAI</strong>. Now at <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> in London, I bring this unique blend of engineering and product thinking to build and scale enterprise lending products.
